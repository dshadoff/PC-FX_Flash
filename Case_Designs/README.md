# Case_Designs

These case deisgns were made Jeff Chen (Twitter: @jeffqchen), who has
graciously granted me permission to put them into the repository together
with the PC Board designs.

### Version 1:

This was a left/right half-case with similar dimensions to the original
PC-FX FX-BMP case.

It is designed to be held together by M2-12 screws (qty 3).


### Version 2:

This version made the sides slightly more asymmetric, with a carve-out on the
handle where the recess is on the PC-FX (to make it easier to remove).
Diagonals on the left side help guide the right side into place (although
there is a small amount of "rotation" possible).

There are also two different right-halves, one for the nvBMP, and one for the
Flash cartridge.

### Version 3:

This version has two principal changes from Version 2:

 1. There are "wells" on the left half to allow for the throuhg-hole pins of
the DIP version of the Flash board to be seated properly.
 2. In order to prevent the "rotation" when aligning the opposite sides, there
are interlocking notches on the diagonals. These can be a bit tight, but definitely
make a good mechinical alignment between sides for faster assembly with the screws.
